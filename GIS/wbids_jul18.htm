<strong><b>GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</b></strong>
<table width="650">
<tr>
<td>
This is a statewide polygon layer in which each polygon has a unique Water Body Identification number (WBID - RUN 55). The assessment units are drainage basins, lakes, lake drainage areas, springs, rivers and streams, segments of rivers and streams, coastal, bay and estuarine waters in Florida. The polygons roughly delineate the drainage basins surrounding the water body assessment units. The WBIDs are used in the Basin Rotation Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program as well as other applications. WBIDs are assigned a FDEP district as part of their attribution. There are multiple instances where a WBID may be assigned to an FDEP district, but physically fall within the boundary of a different district. This is because WBIDs are grouped together into basins called Planning Units and there are instances where a Planning Unit basin will fall across FDEP district boundaries. In these cases, for consistency's sake, all the WBIDs that are in the Planning Unit will be assigned to the same FDEP district. For information on which district the WBID physically falls in, please refer to the FDEP Regulatory Districts layer. This is an update to the FGDL layer WBIDS_DEC17.

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data

FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding

Process Date: <br />
The Watershed Rotation Groups and Schedule (Proposed) coverage was created 
from the drainage basins coverage (basin-24 (area)). The watershed groups were 
created by unioning the drainage basins in the basin-24 cover. The watershed 
groups generally follow the boundaries of the USGS 8-digit HUCS. (Creation of 
the basin-24 (area) dataset) In Spring of '97, the data was converted from NAD27 to 
HPGN using the Arc/INFO projection command within Arc/INFO version 7.0.4. One 
coverage of the entire state, excluding South Florida was digitized using ARC/INFO.
The South Florida coverage was digitized by SFWMD from USGS mylars of 7.5' 
quads dated 1978-1979 by engineers familiar with the landscape using ARC/INFO 
6.1.1. The two coverages were joined to form a statewide coverage using the 
update command, then polygon slivers were eliminated. Check plots were made. The
coverage was converted to Albers Conformal Area projection and exported from the 
VAX VMS system using ARC/INFO. On the DEC/ALPHA UNIX system, the export 
file was imported and inserted into the (quad) library. Since the original creation of the
WBIDS spatial dataset recommended changes to the linework by basin rotation staff 
and outside professionals have been incorporated on a case by case basis. These 
changes are documented in the CHANGES column of the dataset. During August of 
2003 the ARC coverage was converted into a Geodatabase to facilitate the editing 
process in ARCGIS. Geodatabase is joined to Access IWR database to get 
information in specific waterbodies. For more information, contact the Department of 
Environmental Protection or South Florida Water Management District for copies of 
data dictionaries. Dataset copied.

The GeoPlan Center downloaded the Waterbody IDs (WBIDs)
dataset on August 1st, 2018 from the FDEP Data Portal:

Florida Department of Environmental Protection Geospatial Open Data:
http://geodata.dep.state.fl.us/

http://geodata.dep.state.fl.us/datasets/waterbody-ids-wbids

Please Note: Data is also available via the FTP website:
http://publicfiles.dep.state.fl.us/otis/gis/data/WBIDS_SP.zip

WBIDS_SP.zip
WBIDS_SP.gdb

The GDB layer was exported to shapefile.

The dataset's projection was redefined to FGDL Albers.

During the QA/QC process the following tasks were undertaken:
- Redefined the dataset's projection from FDEP Albers to FGDL Albers.
- Deleted the OBJECTID field.
- Uppercased all records in the table.
- A DESCRIPT field was added based on WATERBODY_ and WBID.
- A FGDLAQDATE field was added based on date downloaded from source.
- Renamed file from WBIDS_SP to WBIDS_JUL18.
